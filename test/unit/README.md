This folder contains unit tests. Unit tests are written in typescript and are run with
[ts-jest](https://github.com/kulshekhar/ts-jest) and [jest](https://jestjs.io).

If you want to test the types against the typescript compiler, do it [in this folder](../ts/README.md).

Relevant `npm run` command:
* `_test-unit`
